# Website Content Editing Guide

## How to Edit Your Website Content

Your website now has a built-in admin panel that allows you to edit all text content without touching any code!

### Accessing the Admin Panel

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: `admin.html` (in the same folder as your website)
3. You'll see a user-friendly interface to edit all content

### How to Edit Content

1. **Choose Language**: Click "English" or "Latvian" to edit that language
2. **Reorder Sections**: Drag and drop sections in the "Section Order" area to change their order on the website
3. **Edit Text**: Simply type in any field to change the text
4. **Auto-Save**: Your changes are automatically saved as you type
5. **Preview**: Click "Preview Website" to see your changes on the actual site

### Applying Changes to Live Website

After editing content:

1. Click "Download Files" in the admin panel
2. Two files will download: `en.json` and `lv.json`
3. Replace the files in your `translations/` folder with these new files
4. Upload the updated files to your website hosting
